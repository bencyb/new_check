# Run the following command to create the necessary token table
# ==============================================================
# python manage.py migrate

# create a user
# ==============

# from django.contrib.auth.models import User
# user = User.objects.create_user(username='test', password='test1234')

# create an authentication token for this user
# ==============================================

# from rest_framework.authtoken.models import Token
# token, created = Token.objects.get_or_create(user=user)


# The token.key attribute contains the generated token value
# ==============================================================

# print(token.key)  

# Open Postman and create a new request or open an existing one.

# Click on the "Headers" tab below the request URL field.

# In the "Headers" tab, add a new header by clicking on the "Add" button.

# In the "Key" field, enter "Authorization".

# In the "Value" field, enter the token value preceded by the word "Token" and a space. The header should look like this:

# Key: Authorization
# Value: Token YOUR_TOKEN_VALUE
# Replace YOUR_TOKEN_VALUE with the actual token value you obtained.

# After setting the Authorization header, you can proceed with adding any other required headers and the request body.

# Send the request by clicking on the "Send" button.

# By following these steps, Postman will include the Authorization header with the token value in your requests, and you should be able to access your API endpoint that requires authentication.
